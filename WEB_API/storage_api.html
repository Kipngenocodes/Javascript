<!--The web storage API in JavaScript allows us to store the data in the user's local system or hard disk.
Before the storage API was introduced in JavaScript, cookies were used to store the data in the user's browser.
The main problem with the cookies is that whenever browsers request the data, the server must send it and store it in the browser. 
Sometimes, it can also happen that attackers can attack and steal the data.
Jvascript  have two different objects for storing data: localStorage and sessionStorage

The localStorage object allows you to store the data locally in the key-value pair format in the user's browser.
You can store a maximum of 5 MB data in the local storage.
Whatever data you store into the local storage, it never expires.
However, you can use the removeItem() method to remove the particular or clear() to remove all items from the local storage.
syntax: localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
localStorage.getItem('key');
localstorage.removeItem('key');
