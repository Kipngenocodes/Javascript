// The arrow functions in JavaScript allow us to create a shorter and anonymous function.
// Arrow functions are often used in combination with higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result.   
// Arrow functions are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are called.

/* Syntax :
const varName = (parameters) => {
     function body
};
