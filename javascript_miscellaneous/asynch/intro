asynchronous iteration refers to the ability to iterate 
over asynchronous sequences or collections, such as those returned
 by asynchronous functions or generators. Async iteration is typically 
 used with operations that involve asynchronous tasks, 
such as fetching data from a remote server or reading from a file.
