// Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all
//  the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client
//  was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back
//  to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information.
//  This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.
