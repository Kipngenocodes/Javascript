Syntax Errors
Syntax errors, also called parsing errors,
occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript.
Logical Errors
Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. These errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error. Instead, they occur when you make a mistake in the logic that drives your script and do not get the expected result.
Runtime Errors (Exceptions)
Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation).

<!-- Error Handling in JavaScript -->

# The try...catch...finally Statement

<script>
   try {
      // Code to run
      [break;]
   } 
   catch ( e ) {
      // Code to run if an exception occurs
      [break;]
   }
   [ finally {
      // Code that is always executed regardless of 
      // an exception occurring
   }]
</script>
