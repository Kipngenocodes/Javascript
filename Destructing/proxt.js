/*The JavaScript proxies are objects that allow you to wrap a
particular object and customize the fundamental operations of the object, 
like getting and setting object properties.
*/
// The proxies are used to implement features such as logging, caching, and securities.
// The proxies are used to intercept the operations of an object and customize them.
// The proxies are used to create a new object that wraps the original object and provides a new interface for it.
// Sntax: const obj = new Proxy(targetObj, Handler);
