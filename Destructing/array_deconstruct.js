/*JavaScript Array destructuring allows us to unpack the values from array
and assign them to the variables. After that, you can use the variables 
to access their value and use them in the code. We can perform the array 
structuring using the destructuring assignment. 
The destructuring assignment is a basically a JavaScript expression.
It allows us to unpack the values from arrays or properties from objects
into distinct variables.
