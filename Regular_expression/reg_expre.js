// A regular expression (RegExp) in JavaScript is an object that describes a pattern of characters.
/*It can contain the alphabetical, numeric, and special characters.
 Also, the regular expression pattern can have single or multiple characters.

The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, 
and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions
to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text.*/


// There are two ways to construct the regular expression in JavaScript.
// 1.  Using the RegExp() constructor.
// 2.  Using the regular expression literal.

/* syntax for creating a regular expression using the RegExp() constructor:
            var pattern = new RegExp(pattern, attributes);
            or simply
            var pattern = /pattern/attributes;
