// Asynchronous JavaScript is a programming technique that allows you
//  to perform tasks without blocking the execution of other code.
// Asynchronous JavaScript to make your application multi-threaded. 

// Example of asynchronous JavaScript using setTimeout
// setTimeout is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to execute a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
// It is commonly used to simulate asynchronous behavior in JavaScript. 
// It is a way to perform non-blocking operations in JavaScript.
// It allows you to execute a function after a specified delay without blocking the execution of other code.
// It is commonly used to simulate asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.

// Example of asynchronous JavaScript using setTimeout
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("This message is displayed after a 2-second delay.");
}
, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds
// console.log("This message is displayed immediately.");
