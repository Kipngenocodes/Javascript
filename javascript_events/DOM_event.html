<!-- The DOM events are actions that can be performed on HTML elements. When an event occurs, 
it triggers a JavaScript function. 
This function can then be used to change the HTML element or perform other actions.

Click − This event occurs when a user clicks on an HTML element.
Load − This event occurs when an HTML element is loaded.
Change − This event occurs when the value of an HTML element is changed.
Submit − This event occurs when an HTML form is submitted.

<!-- 
The onclick Event Type
This is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left
button of his mouse. You can put your validation, warning etc., against this event type.

<!-- We use the 'ondblclick' event handler in the code with the element.-->

<!--The onkeydown Event Type
We used the 'keydown' event in the code below with the <input> element. 
Whenever the user will press any key, it will call the customizeInput() function.
