<!--    
The form events in JavaScript are events that are associated with HTML forms.
These events are triggered by user actions when interacting with form elements 
such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, etc. Form events allow you to execute JavaScript
code in response to these actions, enabling you to validate form data, 
perform actions on form submission or reset, and enhance the user experience.-->
