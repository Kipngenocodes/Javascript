<!--The JavaScript addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler function to an HTML element.
This allows you to specify
a function that will be executed when a particular event occurs on the specified element.
Events are a specific occurrence or action like user clicks, keypress or page loads. 
The browser detects these events and triggers associated JavaScript functions
known as event handlers to respond accordingly.

Developers employ the 'addEventListener()' method for linking particular 
HTML elements with specific function behaviours when those events occur. Examples of events
include clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and document loading.

-->
<!-- 
syntax: element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);

Parameters
The addEventListener() method accepts the following parameters 
event − a string that embodies the type of action − for instance, "click", "mouseover", or 
"keydown" among others; will serve as our trigger to execute the given function.
function − a named, anonymous or reference to an existing function is called 
when the specified event occurs; it's essentially the operation that 
facilitates execution at predetermined instances.
options (optional) − it allows for the specification of additional 
settings particularly capturing or once behaviours related to the event listener.

<!-- 
Here element is an HTML element, such as a button, input or div - can
be selected using methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, 
getElementsByTagName and querySelector; these are just a few examples.
The event listener attaches to this particular element.
