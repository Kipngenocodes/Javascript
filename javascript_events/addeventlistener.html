<!--The JavaScript addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler function to an HTML element.
This allows you to specify
a function that will be executed when a particular event occurs on the specified element.
Events are a specific occurrence or action like user clicks, keypress or page loads. 
The browser detects these events and triggers associated JavaScript functions
known as event handlers to respond accordingly.

Developers employ the 'addEventListener()' method for linking particular 
HTML elements with specific function behaviours when those events occur. Examples of events
include clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and document loading.-->
