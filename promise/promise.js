// The promise is an object that represent the completion or failure of an asynchronous operations.
// The promise object is used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
// Can be created using the Promise constructor or by using the async/await syntax.
// The promise object has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
// The promise object has two methods: then() and catch().  
// The callback function accepts two functions, resolve() and reject(), as arguments. 
// The resolve function is called if the promise returns successfully. 
// The reject function is called when taks fails and returns the reason.
